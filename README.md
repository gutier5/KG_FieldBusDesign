# EtherCAT FieldBus System Documentation

This repository contains documentation for the design and specifications of an EtherCAT-based FieldBus system. The system is designed for managing various industrial devices, including sensors, valves, pumps, and a Kuka KRC2 Controller.

## Contents

1. **Design Document**
   - **Filename:** `DEsignFieldBusDesign.docx`
   - This document explains the design choices made for the EtherCAT FieldBus system. It includes details on why EtherCAT was chosen, how non-field sensors are integrated, connector choices, and other considerations.

2. **Bill of Materials (BOM)**
   - **Filename:** `BOM.xlsx`
   - The BOM lists all the components required for the EtherCAT-based system. It includes devices, communication modules, connector types, and placeholders for part numbers.

3. **Block Diagram**
   - **Filename:** `FlowDiagram_FieldBus.vsdx`
   - The block diagram, created in Visio, visually represents the interconnections between different devices in the EtherCAT FieldBus system.



## How to Use

- **Design Document:** Start by reading the `design_document.md` file to understand the rationale behind the design choices and considerations made during the system design.

- **Block Diagram:** Refer to the `block_diagram.png` image or view/edit the `block_diagram.tex` file using a Visio editor to visualize the system architecture.

- **Bill of Materials (BOM):** Open the `bom.md` file to view the list of components required for the EtherCAT FieldBus system. Replace placeholders with actual part numbers.


## Important Notes

- Ensure compatibility of chosen components and verify part numbers before procurement.
- For visualizing the block diagram in Visio, a Visio editor/license may be required.

Feel free to reach out for any clarifications or additional information.
